# Workday_scheduler
A workplace schedular based on date, and time of day between 9-5. Using jQuery and localStorage to input items to list, retrieve items from list, and color the schedular cleanly.

The scheduler diplays the date at the top of the page, and if items have been entered and localStorage hasnt been cleared, it will retrieve the items and allow editing and changing of schedule.
